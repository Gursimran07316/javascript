//anything inside double quotes'', its said to be string

//string just concatenate 
// let score = '103';
// let bonus = '20';
let score = 103;

// console.log(totalScore)

//camel casing is good practice to use as it is more readable bcz varibles have not spaces b/w
const firstName =  'John'
firstName = 'Jane' //.... you can only declare varible for once, otherwise it'll give error
let lastName = 'Doe'

let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName
//console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
console.log(fullName);
